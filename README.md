# Scouter

## Note

~~Scouter is currently in an early Alpha state and as such is subject to change. The software will not be ready for testing until reaching Beta.~~

Scouter is now in Beta! While it is ready for competition use, there are still some bugs that need to be ironed out.

## About

Scouter is a Web app that allows FRC Teams to record match data, save it to a database, and retreive it for analysis. The two main aspects that makes Scouter unique is its ability to load custom database models and it's reliance on a competition legal LAN network. For more information, please refer to this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/NicolasNewman/Scouter/wiki).

## Highlights

- Flexible modules that allow teams to customize the database, data fourm, and analysis page to their liking
- Relies on a network architecture that doesn't need wireless signals, making it competition legal
- Users can connect straight from any browser on Windows, Mac, Linux, and ChromeOS
